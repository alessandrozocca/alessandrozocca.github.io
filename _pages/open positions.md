I currently have two fully-funded, 4-year PhD positions at VU Amsterdam in applied probability and network optimization for climate-aware energy systems, see below for a more detailed description of the two project.

**The deadline for applications is 25/05/2025**. Please apply through the [official link](https://workingat.vu.nl/vacancies/phd-positions-in-applied-probability-and-network-optimization-amsterdam-1161112), applications received by email will not be considered.

Both positions are part of a NWO research project motivated by one of the biggest challenges of our time: keeping the lights on in a world of clean energy and climate extremes. As we move away from fossil fuels and embrace renewables like wind and solar, our power grids must adapt to the rising threat of extreme weather events. This joint research project brings together advanced math, applied probability, and network science to build smarter and more resilient energy systems. By modeling how climate-driven disasters ripple through energy networks and by optimizing how we design and operate them, the goal is to create a new generation of tools that help prevent cascading failure and blackouts —even in the face of storms, heatwaves, and the unpredictable future of our climate.

Within this interdisciplinary research project, each of the two PhD positions tackles a different facet of energy resilience in the face of climate change:  

**Topic 1: Modeling Weather-Driven Failures in Power Grids**
This PhD project uses applied probability and graph theory to develop parsimonious models that describe how extreme weather events—such as floods or storms—can trigger simultaneous failures across multiple components of a power grid. The goal is to understand how these spatially correlated disruptions interact with the network’s structure and dynamics.

**Topic 2: Optimizing Climate-Resilient Grid Operations**
This PhD project focuses on network optimization and stochastic simulation to build a climate-aware decision-making framework for power system planning and real-time operations. It aims to design flexible and cost-effective strategies to reconfigure the network and reduce the risk of large-scale failures under extreme weather conditions.  

The preferred starting date is 01/09/2025.

We are an inclusive, interdisciplinary group, and diversity and internationalism are at the heart of our research principles, as well as our teaching practice. Applications from all groups currently underrepresented in academic posts are especially encouraged. We particularly welcome applications from women and people with ethnic minority backgrounds.
