  title     = "Pricing Uncertainty in Stochastic Multi-Stage Electricity Markets",
  abstract  = "This work proposes a pricing mechanism for multi-stage electricity markets that does not explicitly depend on the choice of dispatch procedure or optimization method. Our approach is applicable to a wide range of methodologies for the economic dispatch of power systems under uncertainty, including multi-interval dispatch, multi-settlement markets, scenario-based dispatch, and chance-constrained dispatch policies. We prove that our pricing scheme provides both ex-ante and expost dispatch-following incentives by simultaneously supporting per-stage and ex-post competitive equilibria. In numerical experiments on a ramp-constrained test system, we demonstrate the benefits of scheduling under uncertainty and show how our price decomposes into components corresponding to energy, intertemporal coupling, and uncertainty.",

In this work, we analyze power grid cascading failures induced by such attacks. The inherent security features in power grids such as the N-1 design philosophy dictate LAAs that can trigger cascading failures are rare events. We overcome the challenge of efficiently sampling critical LAAs scenarios for a wide range of attack parameters by using the so-called 'skipping sampler' algorithm. We conduct extensive simulations using a three-area IEEE-39 bus system and provide several novel insights into the composition of cascades due to LAAs.

Assuming further that the service times are independent and follow an exponential distribution, this system can be described as a two-dimensional Markov chain on a finite triangular region (Formula presented.) of the square lattice. We interpret the resulting random walk on (Formula presented.) as a Dyck path that is weighted according to some state-dependent transition probabilities that are constant along one axis, but are rather general otherwise. We untangle the resulting intricate combinatorial structure by introducing appropriate generating functions that exploit the recursive structure of the model. This allows us to derive an explicit expression for the probability mass function of the number of customers served in any busy period (equivalently, of the length of any excursion of the Dyck path above the diagonal) as a weighted sum with alternating sign over a certain subclass of Dyck paths.",

Specifically, we study events of the form P(LMP∉∏i=1n[αi-,αi+]), where LMP is the vector of LMPs at the n power grid nodes, and α -, α+∈Rn are vectors of price thresholds specifying undesirable price occurrences. By exploiting the structure of the supply-demand matching mechanism in power grids, we look at LMPs as deterministic piecewise affine, possibly discontinuous functions of the stochastic input process, modelling uncontrollable renewable generation. We use techniques from large deviations theory to identify the most likely ways for extreme price spikes to happen, and to rank the nodes of the power grid in terms of their likelihood of experiencing a price spike. Our results are derived in the case of Gaussian fluctuations, and are validated numerically on the IEEE 14-bus test case.

  abstract  = " Transmission line failures in power systems propagate and cascade non-locally. This well-known yet counter-intuitive feature makes it even more challenging to optimally and reliably operate these complex networks. In this work we present a comprehensive framework based on spectral graph theory that fully and rigorously captures how multiple simultaneous line failures propagate, distinguishing between non-cut and cut set outages. Using this spectral representation of power systems, we identify the crucial graph sub-structure that ensures line failure localization -- the network bridge-block decomposition. Leveraging this theory, we propose an adaptive network topology reconfiguration paradigm that uses a two-stage algorithm where the first stage aims to identify optimal clusters using the notion of network modularity and the second stage refines the clusters by means of optimal line switching actions. Our proposed methodology is illustrated using extensive numerical examples on standard IEEE networks and we discussed several extensions and variants of the proposed algorithm. ",

It is also well-known that line failures can propagate non-locally and redundancy can exacerbate cascading. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to grid reliability that (i) judiciously switches off a small number of tie lines so that the control areas are connected in a tree structure; and (ii) leverages a unified frequency control paradigm to provide congestion management in real time. Even though the proposed topology reduces redundancy, the integration of tree structure at regional level and real-time congestion management can provide stronger guarantees on failure localization and mitigation. We illustrate our approach on the IEEE 39-bus network and evaluate its performance on the IEEE 118-bus, 179-bus, 200-bus and 240-bus networks with various network congestion conditions. Simulations show that, compared with the traditional approach, our approach not only prevents load shedding in more failure scenarios, but also incurs smaller amounts of load loss in scenarios where load shedding is inevitable. Moreover, generators under our approach adjust their operations more actively and efficiently in a local manner.",

Specifically we adopt a recently developed distributed frequency regulation approach, called the Unified Control, that integrates primary and secondary control as well as congestion management at frequency control timescale.When the balancing areas over which the Unified Control operates form a tree partition, our proposed strategy will regulate the system to a steady state where the impact of initial line outages is localized within the areas where they occur whenever possible and stop the cascading process. When initial line outages cannot be localized, the proposed strategy provides a configurable design that involves and coordinates progressively more balancing areas for failure mitigation in a way that can be optimized for different priorities. We compare the proposed control strategy with the classical automatic generation control (AGC) on the IEEE 118-bus and 2736-bus test networks. Simulation results show that our strategy greatly improves overall reliability in terms of the N-k security standard, and localizes the impact of initial failures in majority of the load profiles that are examined.
