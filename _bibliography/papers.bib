  abstract = {The energy transition from fossil fuels to sustainable alternatives makes the design of future-proof ships even more important. In the design phase of a ship, it is uncertain how many and which fuels it will use in the future due to many external factors. In fact, a ship typically sails for decades, increasing the likelihood that it will use different fuels during its lifetime. Pipe route design is expensive and time-consuming, mainly done by hand. Motivated by this, in previous research, we have proposed a mathematical optimization framework for automatic pipe routing under uncertainty of the energy transition. In this paper, we build on the state-of-the-art by implementing design constraints in mathematical models based on discussions with maritime design experts. Additionally, we apply these models to realistic, complex situations of a commercial ship design company. Our experiments show that location-dependent installation costs, which reflect reality, increase the usefulness of stochastic optimization compared to deterministic and robust optimization. Additionally, to prepare for a possible transition to more sustainable fuels, we recommend installing suitable pipes near the engine room upfront to prevent expensive retrofits in the future.},

  abstract  = "This work proposes a pricing mechanism for multi-stage electricity markets that does not explicitly depend on the choice of dispatch procedure or optimization method. Our approach is applicable to a wide range of methodologies for the economic dispatch of power systems under uncertainty, including multi-interval dispatch, multi-settlement markets, scenario-based dispatch, and chance-constrained dispatch policies. We prove that our pricing scheme provides both ex-ante and expost dispatch-following incentives by simultaneously supporting per-stage and ex-post competitive equilibria. In numerical experiments on a ramp-constrained test system, we demonstrate the benefits of scheduling under uncertainty and show how our price decomposes into components corresponding to energy, intertemporal coupling, and uncertainty.",

While reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise in managing these networks, through topological actions like bus and line switching, efficiently handling large action spaces as networks grow is crucial. This paper presents a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework tailored for these expansive action spaces, leveraging the power grid's inherent hierarchical nature. Experimental results indicate the MARL framework's competitive performance with single-agent RL methods. We also compare different RL algorithms for lower-level agents alongside different policies for higher-order agents.",

Assuming further that the service times are independent and follow an exponential distribution, this system can be described as a two-dimensional Markov chain on a finite triangular region (Formula presented.) of the square lattice. We interpret the resulting random walk on (Formula presented.) as a Dyck path that is weighted according to some state-dependent transition probabilities that are constant along one axis, but are rather general otherwise. We untangle the resulting intricate combinatorial structure by introducing appropriate generating functions that exploit the recursive structure of the model. This allows us to derive an explicit expression for the probability mass function of the number of customers served in any busy period (equivalently, of the length of any excursion of the Dyck path above the diagonal) as a weighted sum with alternating sign over a certain subclass of Dyck paths.},

It provides a novel perspective on distribution factors that precisely captures Kirchhoff's Law in terms of topological structures. Our results show that the distribution of specific collections of subtrees of the transmission network plays a critical role on the patterns of power redistribution, and motivates the block decomposition of the transmission network as a structure to understand long-distance propagation of disturbances. In Part I of this paper, we present the case when the post-contingency network remains connected after an initial set of lines are disconnected simultaneously.

We establish a Simple Path Criterion, showing that the propagation pattern due to bridge outages, a special case of cut set failures, are fully determined by the positions in the network of the buses that participate in load balancing. We then extend our results to general cut set outages. In contrast to non-cut outages discussed in Part I whose subsequent line failures are contained within the original blocks, cut set outages typically impact the whole network, affecting the power flows on all remaining lines. We corroborate our analytical results in both parts using the IEEE 118-bus test system, in which the failure propagation patterns exhibit a clear block-diagonal structure predicted by our theory, even when using full AC power flow equations.},

  abstract  = "Transmission line failures in power systems propagate and cascade non-locally. This well-known yet counter-intuitive feature makes it even more challenging to optimally and reliably operate these complex networks. In this work we present a comprehensive framework based on spectral graph theory that fully and rigorously captures how multiple simultaneous line failures propagate, distinguishing between non-cut and cut set outages. Using this spectral representation of power systems, we identify the crucial graph sub-structure that ensures line failure localization -- the network bridge-block decomposition. Leveraging this theory, we propose an adaptive network topology reconfiguration paradigm that uses a two-stage algorithm where the first stage aims to identify optimal clusters using the notion of network modularity and the second stage refines the clusters by means of optimal line switching actions. Our proposed methodology is illustrated using extensive numerical examples on standard IEEE networks and we discussed several extensions and variants of the proposed algorithm. ",

It is also well-known that line failures can propagate non-locally and redundancy can exacerbate cascading. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to grid reliability that (i) judiciously switches off a small number of tie lines so that the control areas are connected in a tree structure; and (ii) leverages a unified frequency control paradigm to provide congestion management in real time. Even though the proposed topology reduces redundancy, the integration of tree structure at regional level and real-time congestion management can provide stronger guarantees on failure localization and mitigation. We illustrate our approach on the IEEE 39-bus network and evaluate its performance on the IEEE 118-bus, 179-bus, 200-bus and 240-bus networks with various network congestion conditions. Simulations show that, compared with the traditional approach, our approach not only prevents load shedding in more failure scenarios, but also incurs smaller amounts of load loss in scenarios where load shedding is inevitable. Moreover, generators under our approach adjust their operations more actively and efficiently in a local manner.},

  title     = "Localization & Mitigation of Cascading Failures in Power Systems, Part III: Real-time Mitigation",
  abstract  = " Cascading failures in power systems propagate non-locally, making the control of outages extremely difficult.In Part III of this work, we leverage the properties of tree partitioning developed in Parts I and II to propose a distributed control strategy that offers strong guarantees in both the mitigation and localization of cascading failures. Specifically we adopt a recently developed distributed frequency regulation approach, called the Unified Control, that integrates primary and secondary control as well as congestion management at frequency control timescale.When the balancing areas over which the Unified Control operates form a tree partition, our proposed strategy will regulate the system to a steady state where the impact of initial line outages is localized within the areas where they occur whenever possible and stop the cascading process. When initial line outages cannot be localized, the proposed strategy provides a configurable design that involves and coordinates progressively more balancing areas for failure mitigation in a way that can be optimized for different priorities. We compare the proposed control strategy with the classical automatic generation control (AGC) on the IEEE 118-bus and 2736-bus test networks. Simulation results show that our strategy greatly improves overall reliability in terms of the N-k security standard, and localizes the impact of initial failures in majority of the load profiles that are examined. Moreover, the proposed framework incurs significantly less load loss, if any, compared to AGC, in all of our case studies. ",

  abstract = {Cascading failures in power systems exhibit nonlocal propagation patterns, which make the analysis and mitigation of failures difficult. In this work, we propose a distributed control framework inspired by the recently proposed concepts of unified controller and network tree-partition that offers strong guarantees in both the mitigation and localization of cascading failures in power systems. In this framework, the transmission network is partitioned into several control areas which are connected in a tree structure, and the unified controller is adopted by generators or controllable loads for fast timescale disturbance response. After an initial failure, the proposed strategy always prevents successive failures from happening, and regulates the system to the desired steady state where the impact of initial failures are localized as much as possible. For extreme failures that cannot be localized, the proposed framework has a configurable design, that progressively involves and coordinates more control areas for failure mitigation and, as a last resort, imposes minimal load shedding. We compare the proposed control framework with Automatic Generation Control (AGC) on the IEEE 118-bus test system. Simulation results show that our novel framework greatly improves the system robustness in terms of the N - 1 security standard, and localizes the impact of initial failures in majority of the load profiles that are examined. Moreover, the proposed framework incurs significantly less load loss, if any, compared to AGC.},

Under suitable conditions on the triangular lattice dimensions, this interacting particle system has three maximum-occupancy configurations and we investigate its high-fugacity behavior by studying tunneling times, i.e., the first hitting times between between these maximum-occupancy configurations, and the mixing time. The proof method relies on the analysis of the corresponding state space using geometrical and combinatorial properties of the hard-core configurations on finite triangular lattices, in combination with known results for first hitting times of Metropolis Markov chains in the equivalent zero-temperature limit.

  abstract = {In this paper we consider a stochastic model for a frequency-agile CSMA protocol for wireless networks where multiple orthogonal frequency channels are available. Even when the possible interference on the different channels is described by different conflict graphs, we show that the network dynamics can be equivalently described as that of a single-channel CSMA algorithm on an appropriate virtual network. Our focus is on the asymptotic regime in which the network nodes try to activate aggressively in order to achieve maximum throughput. Of particular interest is the scenario where the number of available channels is not sufficient for all nodes of the network to be simultaneously active and the well-studied temporal starvation issues of the single-channel CSMA dynamics persist. For most networks we expect that a larger number of available channels should alleviate these temporal starvation issues. However, we prove that the aggregate throughput is a non-increasing function of the number of available channels. To investigate this trade-off that emerges between aggregate throughput and temporal starvation phenomena, we propose an analytical framework to study the transient dynamics of multi-channel CSMA networks by means of first hitting times. Our analysis further reveals that the mixing time of the activity process does not always correctly characterize the temporal starvation in the multi-channel scenario and often leads to pessimistic performance estimates.},

  abstract = {Cascading failures in power systems propagate non-locally, making the control and mitigation of outages extremely hard. In this work, we use the emerging concept of the tree partition of transmission networks to provide an analytical characterization of line failure localizability in transmission systems. Our results rigorously establish the well perceived intuition in power community that failures cannot cross bridges, and reveal a finer-grained concept that encodes more precise information on failure propagations within tree-partition regions. Specifically, when a non-bridge line is tripped, the impact of this failure only propagates within well-defined components, which we refer to as cells, of the tree partition defined by the bridges. In contrast, when a bridge line is tripped, the impact of this failure propagates globally across the network, affecting the power flow on all remaining transmission lines. This characterization suggests that it is possible to improve the system robustness by temporarily switching off certain transmission lines, so as to create more, smaller components in the tree partition; thus spatially localizing line failures and making the grid less vulnerable to large-scale outages. We illustrate this approach using the IEEE 118-bus test system and demonstrate that switching off a negligible portion of transmission lines allows the impact of line failures to be significantly more localized without substantial changes in line congestion.},

Correlated and non -Gaussian power disturbances, such as may arise from renewable generation, have been shown to be significant in power system security analysis. We therefore introduce ghost sampling which, given any unconditional distribution of disturbances, efficiently produces samples conditional on a violation occurring. Our goal is to address questions such as “which generator is most likely to be disconnected due to a RoCoF violation?” or “what is the probability of having simultaneous RoCoF violations, given that a violation occurs?”},

In this work we explore how the transport of energy can be more efficient by adding to the network multiple batteries that can coordinate their operations. Such batteries can both charge using the current excess in the network or discharge to meet the network current demand. Either way, the presence of batteries in the network can be leveraged to mitigate the intrinsic uncertainty in the power generation and demand and, hence, transport the energy more efficiently through the network. We consider a resistive DC network with stochastic external current injections or consumptions and show how the expected total heat loss depends on the network structure and on the batteries operations. Furthermore, in the case where the external currents are modeled by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, we derive the dynamical optimal control for the batteries over a finite time interval.},

Focusing on regular meshes as prototypical scenarios, we show that the mean delays in an \(L\times L\) toric grid with normalized load \(\rho\,\) are of the order \(\Big (\frac{1}\{1-\rho\} \Big)^L\). This superlinear delay scaling is to be contrasted with the usual linear growth of the order \(\frac{1}\{(1-\rho)\}\) in conventional queueing networks. The intuitive explanation for the poor delay characteristics is that (i) high load requires a high activity factor, (ii) a high activity factor implies extremely slow transitions between dominant activity states, and (iii) slow transitions cause starvation and hence excessively long queues and delays.
Our proof method combines both renewal and conductance arguments. A critical ingredient in quantifying the long transition times is the derivation of the communication height of the uniformized Markov chain associated with the activity process. We also discuss connections with Glauber dynamics, conductance, and mixing times. Our proof framework can be applied to other topologies as well, and is also relevant for the hard-core model in statistical physics and sampling from independent sets using single-site update Markov chains.},

  abstract = {We consider a stylized stochastic model for a wireless CSMA network. Experimental results in prior studies indicate that the model provides remarkably accurate throughput estimates for IEEE 802.11 systems. In particular, the model offers an explanation for the severe spatial unfairness in throughputs observed in such networks with asymmetric interference conditions. Even in symmetric scenarios, however, it may take a long time for the activity process to move between dominant states, giving rise to potential starvation issues. In order to gain insight in the transient throughput characteristics and associated starvation effects, we examine in the present paper the behavior of the transition time between dominant activity states. We focus on partite interference graphs, and establish how the magnitude of the transition time scales with the activation rate and the sizes of the various network components. We also prove that in several cases the scaled transition time has an asymptotically exponential distribution as the activation rate grows large, and point out interesting connections with related exponentiality results for rare events and meta-stability phenomena in statistical physics. In addition, we investigate the convergence rate to equilibrium of the activity process in terms of mixing times.},
