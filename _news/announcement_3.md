<font color="#000000">I've been awarded a <b>VIDI grant</b> for my research proposal, <i>"Power Network Optimization in the Age of Climate Extremes"</i>! I'm very grateful to the NWO (Dutch Research Council) for the opportunity to develop new mathematical methods for more climate-resilient power grids. See the project description and the other recipients <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/nwo-talent-programme/projects-vidi/vidi-2023">here</a>.</font>
