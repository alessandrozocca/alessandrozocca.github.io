<font color="#000000"> <b>New preprint</b> on dynamic dimensioning of frequency containment reserves, in collaboration with JÃ¶bke Janssen, Bert Zwart, and Jalal Kazempour. This approach leverages a diffusion model for frequency fluctuations and leads to <i>identical grid safety levels but at lower costs!</i> This study focuses on the FCR-N product in the Nordic grid and using their historical frequency data. Check it out <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11093">here</a>!</font>
